## 2. Subscription Pricing Suggestions
**Strategy**: Affordable for students, tiered for power users.

### Plan A: Monthly (Flexibility)
- **Price**: $4.99 / month
- **Target**: Students, trial users.
- **Psychology**: Less than a coffee/sandwich.

### Plan B: Yearly (Commitment - Best Value)

- **Target**: Serious learners, productivity enthusiasts.
- **Incentive**: 7-day free trial included.

### Plan C: Lifetime (Cash Injection)

- **Target**: Loyal users who hate subscriptions.
- **Strategy**: Offer this only during special promos (Back to School, New Year).

## 3. Non-intrusive Ads Strategy
**Principle**: Ads should never block the user's workflow or learning.

### Placements
- **Sidebar (Bottom)**: A sticky 300x250 unit that stays out of the way.
- **Completion Screens**: Show an ad *after* a task list is completed or a lesson is finished (Moment of dopamine).
- **Free User Dashboard**: A thin banner at the very top (dismissible for the session).
- **Resource Download**: Interstitial ad before downloading a free PDF book/resource.

### Ad Types
- **Native Ads**: "Recommended Tools" that look like part of the UI.
- **Programmatic Display**: Google AdSense / header bidding for fill.
- **Direct Sponsorships**: Later stage (e.g., "This productivity streak brought to you by [Brand]").

## 4. Affiliate Opportunities
**Strategy**: Recommend tools that complement PlanHub.

### Categories
- **Books**: Amazon Associates links for books mentioned in the "Resources" section.
- **Learning Platforms**: Coursera, Udemy, Skillshare checks for courses that go deeper than PlanHub.
- **Productivity Tools**: Notion, Evernote, ClickUp (if they have affiliate programs) as "Integrations" or "Alternatives".
- **Physical Gear**: Planners, pens, noise-canceling headphones (via blog posts/guides).

## 5. Conversion Strategy
**Goal**: Move users from SEO Landing Page -> Free User -> PRO User.

### SEO to Free User
- **Clear CTAs**: "Start Planning for Free" or "Test Your Level Now" on every SEO page.
- **Lead Magnets**: "Download our Free Study Planner Template" (requires signup).
- **Interactive Demos**: Mini-version of the tool directly on the landing page (e.g., a simple checklist test).

### Free to PRO User
